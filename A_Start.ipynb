The device analyzes 10 seconds of a single 12- lead ECG acquisition, and within seconds provides a prediction of likelihood of LVEF (ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%) to third party software. The results are displayed by the third - party software on a device such as a smartphone, tablet, or PC. The Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG Algorithm was trained to predict Low LVEF using positive and control cohorts, and the prediction of Low LVEF in patients is generated using defined conditions and covariates. The Low Ejection Fraction AI-ECG Algorithm device is intended to address the unmet need for a point-of- care screen for LVEF less than or equ al to 40% and is expected to be used by K232699 Page 1 of 9510(k) Summary Low Ejection Fraction AI ECG Algorithm cardiologists, front -line clinicians at primary care, urgent care, and emergency care settings, where cardiac imaging may not be available or may be difficult or unreliable for clinicians to operate. Clinicians will use the Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG Algorithm to aid in screening for LVEF less than or equal to 40% and making a decision for further cardiac evaluation. 3 Intended Use/\n",
      "3 :  The Anumana Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG Algorithm is software intended to aid in screening for Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 40% in adults at risk for heart failure. This population includes, but is not limited to: • patients with cardiomyopathies • patients who are post -myocard ial infarction • patients with aortic stenosis • patients with chronic atrial fibrillation • patients receiving pharmaceutical therapies that are cardiotoxic, and • postpartum women. A numana Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG Algorithm is not intended to be a stand -alone diagnostic device for cardiac conditions, should not be used for monitoring of patients, and should not be used on ECGs with a paced rhythm. A positive result may suggest the need for further clinical evaluation in order to establish a diagnosis of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 40%. Additionally, if the patient is at high risk for the cardiac condition, a negative result should not rule out further non-invasive evaluation. T he Anumana Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG Algorithm should be applied jointly with clinician judgment. 4 Technological Characteristics The subject device, Anumana’s Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG Algorithm, is a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) provided as a software module packaged in a Docker container. The Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG Algorithm does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) of its own. It is integrated with other medical systems such as Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems or ECG Management Systems (EMS). The third -party integrating software furnishes a 12-lead ECG digital waveform as input to the Low Ejection Fraction AI-ECG Algorithm and records the algorithm output for display via the integrated medical system or for printing in anoffline report. 5 Summary of Clinical Performance Data The performance characteristics for the Low Ejection Fraction AI-ECG Algorithm have been clinically validated for the presence of a low ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40% in patients, with a sensitivity and specificity greater than the study’s predetermined acceptance criteria (80%). K232699 Page 2 of 9510(k) Summary Low Ejection Fraction AI ECG Algorithm Table 1: Performance Characteristics Performance Characteristic Value Sensitivity 80% or higher Specificity 80% or higher A lgorithm Training To develop the Anumana Low Ejection Fraction AI -ECG (Low EF ECG -AI) algorithm, 93,722 patients with an ECG and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed within a 2 -week interval were identified from a research use authorized clinical database from Mayo Clinic. For each patient, t he left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurement from the earliest TTE was selected and paired with the closest ECG recording within a 2-week interval of the TTE. The disease cohort was defined as LVEF ≤ 40% and consisted of 11% of the overall cohort. The control cohort was defined as LVEF > 40% and consisted of 89% of the overall cohort. The cohorts were split into training (50%), tuning (20%) and set-aside testing (30%) datasets. Within the set -aside test set, the sensitivity and specificity of th e algorithm were 85.7% and 84.2%, respectively. P erformance analyses were also conducted in subgroups of age, sex, and race. Within the training set- aside test dataset, 91.2% of patients were White, 1.4% Black/African American, 1.3% Asian, 0.4% American Indian and 5.7% were of other or unknown races. Patients were 57.6% male and 43.4% female. The average age was 61.5 (± 16.4) years and 11.2% of patients were under age 40, 10.0% were 40-49, 18.1% were 50-59, 25.9% were 60-69, 22.3% were 70-79, and 12.5% were over 80. S ummary of Clinical Validation St udy Design The performance profile of the Anumana Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG (Low EF AI -ECG) algorithm was validated in a retrospective study of 16,000 patient records across 4 health systems across the United States and 16,000 patients. The objective of the study was to establish the diagnostic performance of the device for the purpose of detecting the pre sence of an EF ≤ 40% in a clinically and demographically diverse population. The sole inclusion criteria for a subject was age ≥ 18 and the availability of at least one digital 12 -lead ECG paired with an echocardiogram with quantitative left ventricular ej ection fraction (LVEF) information within 30 days following the date of the ECG. Candidate cases were identified in reverse chronological order from the date the site was activated. For each patient, the most recent echocardiogram was paired with the most recent ECG (without pacing present) acquired for that patient prior to the echocardiogram, up to the 30 days limit. Four models of 12- L ECGs (GE D ash 3000, GE MAC® 5500 Resting Analysis System, GE MAC VU360 Resting ECG, and Philips PageWriter TC70 ECG mach ines (model 860315) were represented in the ECG inputs to the algorithm. Sum mary of Study Results Each of the 4 sites contributed 4,000 patient-ECG pairs to a final pool of 16,000 patient- ECG pairs. The study sample was representative of the US population and was 65.9% White, 11.0% K232699 Page 3 of 9510(k) Summary Low Ejection Fraction AI ECG Algorithm Hispanic, 10.1% Black/African American, 5.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 2.2% Asian, and 0.4% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. The sample consisted of 52% male and 48% female participants. The average age as 66 and 11.6% of participants were under age 40, 9.2% were 40 -49, 15.8% were 50-59, 22.8% were 60-69, 21.6% were 70-79, and 19% were over 80. A total of 2,040 records were excluded as a result of the quality checks performed by the Anumana Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG (Low EF AI -ECG) algorithm. W ithin this diverse study sample, a total of 1,096 LVEF ≤ 40% cases were identified (prevalence of 7.9%) from 13,960 samples. The Anumana Low EF ECG- AI device achieved a sensitivity of 84.5% (95% CI of 82.2% to 86.6%), a specificity of 83.6% (95% CI of 82.9% to 84.2%), a positive predictive value of 30.5% (PPV, 95% CI of 28.8% to 32.1%), and a negative predictive value of 98.4% (NPV, 95% CI of 98.2% to 98.7%). Results are provided in Figure 1 : Matrix of primary results with s ubgroup analyses results provided in Table 2: Subgroup Analyses. Fi gure 1: Matrix of primary results Subg roup Analyses Subgroup assessments of diagnostic performance were conducted to determine if there was heterogeneity in device performance across clinical sites, demographics, clinical characteristics, conduction disorders, ECG manufacturer, and ECG devices. To assess for heterogeneity, Breslow - Day tests for the strata were conducted on the odds ratio for condition presence given a positive ECG- AI result. The results are summarized in Table 2 below. K232699 Page 4 of 9510(k) Summary Low Ejection Fraction AI ECG Algorithm Ta ble 2: Subgroup Analyses Subgroup Analysis Result of Test for Heterogeneity Clinical Site Not statistically significant Biological Sex Not statistically significant Race/Ethnicity Not statistically significant Age Group Diagnostic performance varied across age strata (p < 0.01). The diagnostic odds ratio was higher than the overall estimate in patients aged 40 to 69 years and lower in younger and older patients. In younger patients, sensitivity was lower while specificity was higher, whereas in patients of advanced age, sensitivity was higher while specificity was lo wer. Clinical Characteristics ●Diagnostic performance varied across body mass index strata (p = 0.02), with the lowest diagnostic performance observed in underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) participants and the highest diagnostic performance observed in overweig ht (BMI 25+ to <30) and obese (BMI 30+) participants. ●Diagnostic performance varied across certain elements of medical history derived from ICD9/ICD10 codes in patient medical records. The diagnosticodds ratio was lower in patients with prior history of heart failure (p<0.01), myocardial infarction (p<0.01) and coronary revascularization (p=0.07). I n each of these cases, the disease prevalence was high (>17% for the thr ee c onditions) and the algorithm had higher sensitivity and lower specificity. This co mbination, at the higher prevalence values, resulted in robust positive predictive value (>35%) and negative predictive value (>94%). Conduction Disorders Not statistically significant ECG Manufacturer Not statistically significant ECG Device Not statistically significant 6 Summary of Non -Clinical Performance Data The performance characteristics for the Low Ejection Fraction AI-ECG Algorithm have been evaluated with the following non- clinical testing: software verification and validation (per IEC 62304) , cybersecurity, labeling validation, and human factors. Subs tantial Equivalence Conclusion The subject device, Anumana Low Ejection Fraction AI- ECG Algorithm, is substantially equivalent to the predicate device Viz HCM (DEN230003). The devices have similar intended uses, principles of operation, and technical characteristics. Where differences occur between the subject device and the predicate, results of clinical performance and results of non- clinical verification and validation demonstrate that the subject device is as safe and as effective as the predicate.
